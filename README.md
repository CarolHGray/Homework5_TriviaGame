# TriviaGame --- Classic Rock Era Music

Homework 5 assignment required us to create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

To play the game, the user will guess the right answer to twenty Questions about music from the 1970's and 1980's.  Multiple choice format lets the player select correct answer from four options. 



### Instructions:

Click Start to begin the trivia. You have 10 seconds to answer each question and a counter will be displayed to show how much time is reamining. The app will let you know whether your answer was correct or not, then display the correct choice.
At the end of the game, your count of correct and incorrect answers will be displayed.  


If you score a perfect 20, OK Boomer, that's pretty good, but you may want to give some new music a chance.
